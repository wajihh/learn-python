The code snippet you provided involves importing two functions (`print_llm_response` and `get_llm_response`) from a module named `helper_functions`. To use this code while working in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your laptop, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Your Python Environment**
   - **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). During installation, check the box that adds Python to your system PATH.
   - **Install VS Code**: If you haven't already, download and install Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### 2. **Create a New Python Project in VS Code**
   - **Open VS Code**: Launch VS Code.
   - **Create a New Folder**: Create a new folder on your computer where you will store your project files.
   - **Open Folder in VS Code**: In VS Code, go to `File > Open Folder...` and select the folder you just created.
   - **Create a Python File**: Inside the folder, create a new Python file (e.g., `main.py`) by right-clicking in the Explorer panel and selecting `New File`.

### 3. **Add the `helper_functions` Module**
   - **Create the `helper_functions.py` File**: In the same folder as your `main.py`, create a new file named `helper_functions.py`.
   - **Define the Functions**: Add the definitions for `print_llm_response` and `get_llm_response` inside the `helper_functions.py` file. If the course provided code for these functions, paste it here. If not, you might need to write these functions based on your understanding.

   Example structure of `helper_functions.py`:
   ```python
   def print_llm_response(response):
       # Implementation for printing LLM response
       print(response)

   def get_llm_response(input_text):
       # Implementation for getting LLM response
       return "This is a mock LLM response for input: " + input_text
   ```

### 4. **Use the Functions in Your `main.py` File**
   - **Write Your Code**: In `main.py`, you can now import and use the functions from `helper_functions.py` as shown in your course.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   from helper_functions import print_llm_response, get_llm_response

   # Example usage of the functions
   user_input = "What is AI?"
   response = get_llm_response(user_input)
   print_llm_response(response)
   ```

### 5. **Run Your Code**
   - **Select Interpreter**: Make sure you select the correct Python interpreter in VS Code. You can do this by clicking on the Python version displayed in the bottom-left corner and selecting the appropriate interpreter.
   - **Run the Script**: Press `F5` or right-click on `main.py` and select `Run Python File` to execute your code.

### 6. **Install Required Packages (if any)**
   - If your project requires external packages, you can install them using pip. Open the terminal in VS Code (`View > Terminal`) and run:
     ```sh
     pip install <package_name>
     ```

### 7. **Troubleshooting**
   - **Module Not Found Error**: If you encounter a "ModuleNotFoundError," ensure that `helper_functions.py` is in the same directory as `main.py` or adjust the import path accordingly.
   - **Syntax Errors**: Double-check for syntax errors or typos in your code. VS Code's integrated linter can help identify and fix these.
